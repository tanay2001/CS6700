# CS6700: Reinforcement Learning
All assignments were hosted on the [AIcrowd platform](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/iit-m-2021-assignment-2)

### Assignemnt 2

- taxi.py: contains implementation of the policy Iteration algorithm <br>
- youtube.py : contains the implementation of the DP algorithm fo finite horizon MDP settings
- gridworld.py : contains the implementation of both Value Iteration and Policy Iteration algorithms, it has the optimized version of value Iteration that converges faster.
